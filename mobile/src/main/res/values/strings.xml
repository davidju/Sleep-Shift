    <string name="melatonin_explanation">Melatonin is a natural hormone that the body produces to induce sleep. Melatonin
        is produced when it is dark, and melatonin production is directly inhibited by light. Thus, users who need to sleep
        earlier than they are used to may find taking melatonin to be helpful in helping them fall asleep when they need to. As a
        result, studies have shown that melatonin has been especially effective in helping prevent jet lag in this way.</string>
    <string name="light_control_explanation">Whether our bodies\' natural circadian rhythms align with the
        environment are determined by several factors, with one of the most important ones being light. Bright light exposure
        can cause a \'phase shift\', an advance or delay in circadian rhythms. Thus, by carefully controlling our exposure to light,
        we can use phase shifting to match our circadian rhythms to our destination\'s time zone, preventing jet lag.</string>

        The top horizontal axis represents time in your set origin, while the bottom horizontal axis represents time in your destination.
